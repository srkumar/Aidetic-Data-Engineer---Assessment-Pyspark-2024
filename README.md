**# Aidetic-Data-Engineer---Assessment-Pyspark-2024**
**Assignment based on Pyspark**

**Tasks:**
  1.Load the dataset into a PySpark DataFrame.
  2.Convert the Date and Time columns into a timestamp column named Timestamp.
  3.Filter the dataset to include only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 5.0. 
  4.Calculate the average depth and magnitude of earthquakes for each earthquake type.
  5.Implement a UDF to categorize the earthquakes into levels (e.g., Low, Moderate, High) based on their magnitudes.
  6.Calculate the distance of each earthquake from a reference location (e.g., (0, 0)).
  7.Visualize the geographical distribution of earthquakes on a world map using appropriate libraries (e.g., Basemap or Folium).
  8.Please include the final csv in the repository.

**Dataset Definition:**
Use the earthquake dataset with the following columns:
  Date (string): Date of the earthquake.
  Time (string): Time of the earthquake.
  Latitude (float): Latitude of the earthquake location.
  Longitude (float): Longitude of the earthquake location.
  Type (string): Type of earthquake.
  Depth (float): Depth of the earthquake.
  Magnitude (float): Magnitude of the earthquake.
